Class scheduler 

Things to think about: rooms, times,  seats, class requirnments (computers, black boards, ect.), midterms and finals scheduling, room capacity, office hours, possible calender views for divisions, TA session scheduling, faculty meetings, hiring meetings.
There are about 300 class spaces that are needed. 
Possibly take into account uniform class schedule. 
Whose going to be affected: students, staff, facaulty, cleaners, res life staff, administrators, department, divison staff.
We want to be able to change classes manually
we want it to interface with new college things, but not be part of the system (authentification?)

There are currently 850 students, 50 professors, 80 staff and we are going to 1200 students, 120 professors, 100 staff; from 6000 interactions to 15,000 interactions.
