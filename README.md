Class scheduler 

Things to think about: rooms, times,  seats, class requirnments (computers, black boards, ect.), midterms and finals scheduling, room capacity, office hours, possible calender views for divisions, TA session scheduling, faculty meetings, hiring meetings.
There are about 300 class spaces that are needed. 
Possibly take into account uniform class schedule. 
Whose going to be affected: students, staff, facaulty, cleaners, res life staff, administrators, department, divison staff.
We want to be able to change classes manually
we want it to interface with new college things, but not be part of the system (authentification?)

There are currently 850 students, 50 professors, 80 staff and we are going to 1200 students, 120 professors, 100 staff; from 6000 interactions to 15,000 interactions. 

Interview from Joyce (wasn't too helpful, she's a little old so she doesn't really understand lol):
She said that in the current system she puts her stuff into banner and then has to go into EMS (idk what this is) to input all the class times and rooms that are desried. Within EMS she the process is even more of a hassle becasue you have to input the date and then find the classroom to even see if it's avalible and then you have to go back out of that to do a room request. So she would like to see it all in one place. 
She currently creates it all in word
she said that class size gets room preference; but it primarily works on a first come first serve basis and that if there are conflicts that the professors work it out between themselves and then tell her who gets what. 
We have four computer labs on campus: 2 - 20 computers, 1 - 34 computers, and one with about 8. 
She doesn't need a calender view, but I honestly think that she would like it if we could do it right. 
She likes having all of the information for the classes in one place: description, course code, room, time, etc. 
she said that the most classrooms that get used by the most amount of people are the library classrooms, but that divisions usually stay in their own areas (nat sci to heiser, humanities to ace, social science to the bay front buildings, or empty spaces)

I also ran into some other professors in the copy room and when I mentioned the project they got excited and wanted to give input but wanted to give it in a little bit more of a structured way, like a form or what not. 

Joyce gave me another person to talk to who finalizes the scheudle: Susan Bush in the records and registration office.
